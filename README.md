# sideproject_ballrun

It's a side project of my master thesis ball run, using reinforcement with naive deep q_network to see how AI playing marble run.

For the beginning, the simulation is reduced to 2D and using the similar idea for playing Atari.

The binary files "dynamics" and "track" may just work under linux environment or need to recompile for Mac OS.
